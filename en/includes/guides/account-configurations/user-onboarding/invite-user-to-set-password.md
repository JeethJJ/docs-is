# Invite user to set password

Allow administrator to invite users to set their own passwords during the onboarding process in {{product_name}}.

## Configuration instructions

For inviting users to set their password, follow these instructions:

{% if (is_version is defined and is_version > "7.1.0") or product_name == "Asgardeo" %}
1. On the {{product_name}} Console, go to **Login & Registration** > **User Onboarding** > **Invite User to Set Password**.
2. Enable the **Invite User to Set Password** feature to invite user to set the password after user creation.
3. From **Choose invitation method**, select Email Link to send an invitation link. Alternatively, select OTP (delivered via Email or SMS) to start the invitation flow.
4. Set the **Invitation link/OTP expiry time** in minutes.
This defines how long the password setup invitation email or OTP remains valid.
    - For infinite validity, set -1
    - Setting 0 causes immediate expiry
5. If you want to send an account activation confirmation notification, enable the **Send account activation notification**.
6. Select the **Lock account until password is set** to lock the user account during user creation.
7. Configure the OTP code options from **OTP Code Configuration**: enable uppercase, lowercase, and numeric characters, then set the desired OTP code length.

    !!! note
        When using OTP invitation method, users can use the received OTP as a temporary password to log in. The system redirects users to the password setup page after login to create their permanent password.

8. Click **Update** to save the changes.
