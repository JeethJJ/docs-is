# Flows

In Asgardeo, a **flow** defines the sequence of steps a user goes through during a specific interaction. This can include forms, verification steps, conditional logic, and other actions that guide the user from start to finish.

Supported flows include:

- [Self Registration]({{base_path}}/guides/flows/self-registration/) <br>
    Create registration experiences for new users, with support for multi step forms, validations, and identity verification.

- [Password Recovery]({{base_path}}/guides/flows/password-recovery/) <br>
    Build secure recovery processes to help users regain access, using steps such as email verification or one time passcodes.

Each flow can be composed using a variety of starter templates, widgets, steps, and components, giving you full control over how users interact with your application.
