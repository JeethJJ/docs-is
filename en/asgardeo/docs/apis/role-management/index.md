# Role management

{{ product_name }} supports role management through different versions of the SCIM2 Roles API.

!!! note
    {{ product_name }} deprecated the `SCIM 2.0 Roles API (v2)` API.

## Roles API (V3)

The SCIM2 Roles V3 API introduces a permission model that separates role metadata management and role assignment operations. This allows administrators to delegate responsibilities more preciselyâ€”for example, allowing one set of users to create and edit roles, while another manages user and group assignments.

!!! note
    You can't register `SCIM2 Roles V1/V2 API` and `SCIM2 Roles V3 API` under the same application. Before you register the `SCIM2 Roles V3 API`, remove the `SCIM2 Roles V1/V2 API` resource.

**Key changes in V3:**

- The `internal_role_mgt_update` permission handled both role metadata updates and role assignments. V3 splits these operations as below:

  - `internal_role_mgt_meta_update`: for metadata updates.

  - `internal_role_mgt_users_update`: for user assignments.

  - `internal_role_mgt_groups_update`: for group assignments.

- Console roles with permissions `Roles` lose assignment privileges under V3. To keep role assignment capabilities, update these roles to include `Role Assignments` permissions.

### Register SCIM2 Roles V1/V2 API under an application

1. If you have registered `SCIM2 Roles V1/V2 API` resource already, remove it by clicking on the bin button next to the `SCIM2 Roles V1/V2 API`.
2. Add `SCIM2 Roles V3 API` by following this [API Authorization with Role Based Access Control guide]({{base_path}}/guides/authorization/api-authorization/api-authorization).
3. Update existing application role with the `SCIM2 Roles V3 API` permissions by following this [Edit permissions of a role guide]({{base_path}}/guides/users/manage-roles/#edit-permissions-of-a-role).
