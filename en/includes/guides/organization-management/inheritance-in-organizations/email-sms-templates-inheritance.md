# Email and SMS template inheritance

In {{product_name}}, child organizations inherit email and SMS templates from the organizational hierarchy. Child organizations can make their own adjustments to these inherited templates.

Organization administrators can access email and SMS templates from the {{product_name}} Console under **Branding** > **Email Templates** and **Branding** > **SMS Templates** respectively.

## How it works

Inheritance for email and SMS templates works as follows.

- Child organizations inherit email and SMS templates from the nearest ancestor with custom templates. If no ancestor has customized templates, the default templates apply.

- Organizations can customize their own email and SMS templates, overriding the inherited templates. These overridden templates then pass down to the organizationâ€™s descendants.

- Organizations can also revert their email and SMS templates, restoring the inherited values.
