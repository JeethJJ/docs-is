# User attribute inheritance

In {{product_name}}, child organizations inherit user attributes, user store mappings, and dialects from the root organization, ensuring consistency across the organization hierarchy.

## How it works

This section explains the inheritance mechanism for attributes, user store mappings, and dialects across organizations.

### User attributes

- Child organizations inherit both the system-defined and custom attributes from the root organization.

- Only the root organization can create custom attributes.

Organization administrators can access inherited user attributes from the {{product_name}} Console under **User Attributes & Stores** > **User Attributes**.

### User store mappings

Each user store in an organization maintains mappings for user attributes. Inheritance of user store mappings works in the following way.

{% if product_name == "WSO2 Identity Server" %}
- **Primary user store**

    - Only the root organization can edit the user store mappings for the primary user store.

    - Child organizations inherit primary user store mappings from the root organization.

- **Secondary user stores**

    - Child organizations can onboard their own secondary user stores.

    - Child organizations have full control over user store mappings for secondary user stores, including:

        - Editing mappings for user attributes inherited by the root organization.

        - Whether to enable multi-valued user attributes (e.g. emailAddresses) for the secondary user stores. This option is only available for supported attributes.

    Organization administrators can access user store mappings from the {{product_name}} Console by selecting an attribute from **User Attributes & Stores** > **User Attributes** and going to its **Attribute Mappings** tab.

    The following diagram illustrates the attribute mapping section for the multi-valued `emailAddresses` attribute.

    ![Attribute mappings]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/organization/attributes/b2b-edit-attribute-mappings.png){: width="700" style="display: block; margin: 0;"}

    - Organizations can't edit the attribute mapping or disable it for the primary user store (**PRIMARY**).

    - Child organizations can edit attribute mappings for secondary user stores (**MY USER STORE**).


    {% else %}

    - Child organizations can onboard their own user stores.

    - They have full control over attribute mappings for these user stores, including:

        - Editing mappings for attributes inherited by the root organization.

        - Whether to enable multi-valued user attributes (e.g. emailAddresses) for the user stores. This option is only available for supported attributes.

    Organization administrators can access user store mappings from the {{product_name}} Console by selecting an attribute from **User Attributes & Stores** > **User Attributes** and going to its **Attribute Mappings** tab.

    The following diagram illustrates the attribute mapping section for the multi-valued `emailAddresses` attribute.

    ![Attribute mappings]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/organization/attributes/  b2b-edit-attribute-mappings.png){: width="700" style="display: block; margin: 0;"}

    Child organizations can manage and disable attributes for user stores (**MY USER STORE**).

{% endif %}

### Attribute dialects

Attribute dialects define the naming and format of user attributes when exchanging data with external systems.

- Child organizations inherit all external attribute dialects defined in the root organization, such as:

    - SCIM 2.0

    - OpenID Connect (OIDC)

    {% if product_name == "WSO2 Identity Server" %}

    - Any custom dialects created at the root organization level

    {% endif %}

- Attribute dialects are read-only for child organizations. They can't create new dialects or modify inherited ones.

Organization administrators can view user attribute dialects from the {{product_name}} Console by going to **User Attributes & Stores** > **User Attributes** and selecting the relevant dialect under **Manage Attribute Mappings**.

## Configure user attributes at the root organization

Root organization administrators can create user attributes, user store mappings and dialects at the root organization. Follow the [Manage attributes and mappings]({{base_path}}//users/attributes/) guide to learn more.
